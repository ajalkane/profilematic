	<h2>ProfileMatic</h2>

	ProfileMatic changes automatically your profile (Silent, Beep, Ringing) according to rules defined by the user. With Ringing profile also used volume can be set.
<p>
Time based rules are just the start. I am gathering user feedback for now on what's needed to improve the time based rules and basic functionality of the application.
